Undergraduate Project for Biomedical Engineering degree @ UPC Barcelona

Prediction of patient outcomes using Deep Learning
* Readmission risk
* Mortality

MIMIC III v1.4 analysis

Work in progress: 

- [x] Access and install MIMIC database
- [x] Define relevant features
- [x] Create queries to extract data
- [x] Preprocess mimic data
- [x] Explore and plot features and relationships
- [x] Prepare data to neural networks
- [ ] Design, train and evaluate neural networks
  - [x] Readmission labels
  - [ ] Readmission time delta
  - [ ] Mortality labels
  - [ ] Mortality time delta

Neural networks:
- Readmission labels:
  - Accuracy: 85%
  - Loss: 0.34 

Due date: October 2018

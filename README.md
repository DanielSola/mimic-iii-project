Undergraduate Project for Biomedical Engineering degree @ UPC Barcelona

Prediction of extra-hospital mortality in critic patients using artificial neural networks. 

Designed using Keras in Python 3.6 Anaconda. 

MIMIC III v1.4 database analysis

Work in progress: 

- [x] Access and install MIMIC database
- [x] Define relevant features
- [x] Create queries to extract data
- [x] Preprocess mimic data
- [x] Explore and plot features and relationships
- [x] Prepare data to neural network
- [x] Train and evaluate neural networks
- [x] Optimize hyperparameters+
- [x] Evaluate predictive model

Result: Created neural network able to classify critical patients mortality in three groups with overall 0.82 AUROC

* < 1 month mortality: 0.89 AUROC, 0.79 accuracy
* 1 - 12 months mortality: 0.72 AUROC, 0.47 accuracy
* \> 1 month mortality: 0.81 AUROC, 0.57 accuracy

README's and documentation written in Spanish. 

Due date: October 2018
